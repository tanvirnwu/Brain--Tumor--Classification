## Dataset
Here I have used a [publicly available dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data') and used several classification algorithms to classify the tumor.
There are 4 classes in the dataset:
1. Glioma Tumor
2. Meningioma Tumor
3. Pituitary Tumor
4. No Tumor

## Frameworks
- PyTorch

## Models
I use the following models to classify Brain Tumor:
- AlexNet
- MobileNetV2

## Saved Models
I have saved the best performing model in the `Saved Models` folder.

## Results
- Single Inference has been done the separate notebook `Inference.ipynb` on the test_loader dataset which has not been used to train the models.
- Inference outputs are saved in the `Inference Images` folder.
- `Training Results` folder contains the training results of the models during training for example, training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, validation accuracy, etc.
