## Dataset
Here I have used a [publicly dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data) and used several classification algorithms to classify the tumor.

## Frameworks
- PyTorch

## Models
Here I showed several pretrained classification models such as:
- AlexNet
- MobileNetV2

## Saved Models
I have saved the best performing model in the `Saved Models` folder.

## Results
- Single Inference has been done the separate notebook `Inference.ipynb` on the test_loader dataset which has not been used to train the models.
- Inference outputs are saved in the `Inference Images` folder.
